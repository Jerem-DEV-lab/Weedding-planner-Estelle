As a lay <strong>ceremony officiant</strong>, my role is to amaze and move you.\n\nYour ceremony is your moment! Imagined for you.\n\nI am a certified <strong>ceremony officiant</strong> for several years, I organize this moment with you and in your image.\n\nIf you have no idea where this unforgettable moment will take place, I will be able to advise you a place which resembles you (On the sand, in a garden, in a forest, entrance of a castle...)",

You can exchange your vows and commitments, and make this moment unique with your family and friends.\nYour family and friends will also be able to reinforce this moment of emotion, by their speech and attentions.\n\nHUMOR, EMOTION AND COMMITMENTS will be the key words of this unforgettable day!",
